IntelliJ Plugin Template is a repository that provides a pure boilerplate for creating a plugin project with ease
designed as a GitHub template repository (check the [Creating a repository from a template][gh-template] article).
The main goal for this Template is to speed up the setup phase of the plugin development for the new as well as existing
developers by preconfiguring the project scaffold, CI and linking to the proper documentation pages as well as keeping
everything in the most straightforward manner.

We can detail here the following parts:

- Gradle configuration
- Sample code:
  - listeners - project and dynamic plugin lifecycle
  - services - project- and application-related services 
  - actions - basic action with shortcut binding
- Plugin Manifest file
- README Template
- CI based on GitHub actions
- Release and changelog maintenance flow
